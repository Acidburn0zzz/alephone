0.1 What is This?
-----------------

This is a reference for writing lua scripts to work in A1.
At the time of creation, it lists every trigger and function available to lua scripts.
It is expected that lua functionality will grow in A1, and as it does, so will this document.
Not everything here is completely documented, and any help fixing that would be appreciated.

This is not a reference for lua itself - see lua.org for that.


0.2 Running a Script
--------------------

There are two ways to get a script to run -
level specific MML, and selecting a script at the gather network game dialog.

To use level specific MML, put the script in a TEXT resource in the map file.
Then put in TEXT resource 128 MML telling A1 where to find the script,
which in its most basic form is this:

	<marathon_levels>

	<level index="0">
	<lua resource="1000"/>
	</level>

	</marathon_levels>

By convention we use TEXT resource 1000+x to hold the script for level x,
so the first level in the map file (which has level index 0) gets its script
in TEXT resource 1000.

This works fine for single player games.  It will also work for multiplayer games,
but only if every player has a copy of the map file and selects it in enviroment prefs.

To use a script via the network game dialog, put then script in a text file.
Then, at the gather network game dialog, select "use script", then select your script file.

When playing network games, even if you are not gathering, it's important not to have
a map file with level specific MML selected in your environment prefs, unless it's the
map file for the map you are playing.  A1 will run the script for that map file,
your game will go out of sync, and you'll be unhappy.


0.3 Units
---------

The unit for distance we use is World Units (WU)
These are the same values you'd see in Forge or with F10 location display,
and 1/1024 of what A1 uses internally and what you'd see in Pfhorte.

Units for speed are . . . well let's say they're messy.  :)


1. Triggers
-----------

These are functions scripts can define which A1 will call at specific times or events.


init()

At beginning of level.


cleanup()

At end of the level.
Primarily this is intended as a last chance for changing netgame scores before the postgame report.


idle()

At each tick, before physics and such

postidle()

At each tick, after physics and such, but before rendering


start_refuel(type, player, side_index)

Whenever a player starts to use a refuel panel.


end_refuel(type, player, side_index)

Whenever a player stops using a refuel panel.


tag_switch(tag, player)

Whenever a player uses a tag switch.
Not called when a projectile (e.g., fists) uses a tag switch.


light_switch(light, player)

Whenever a player uses a light switch.
Not called when a projectile (e.g., fists) uses a light switch.


platform_switch(platform, short player)

Whenever a player uses a platform switch.
Not called when a projectile (e.g., fists) uses a platform switch.


terminal_enter(terminal_id, player)

Whenever a player starts using a terminal.


terminal_exit(terminal_id, player)

Whenever a player stops using a terminal.


pattern_buffer(buffer_id, player)

Whenever a player uses a pattern buffer.


got_item(type, player)

Whenever a player picks up an item.
Also whenever a player gets an item when a script calls add_item().


light_activated(index)

Whenever a light is activated or deactivated.


platform_activated(index)

Whenever a platform is activated or deactivated.


player_revived(player)

Whenever a player revives.  (Presumably only happens in a netgame)
Not called when a player first enters into a level.


player_killed(player, aggressor_player, action, projectile)

Whenver a player dies.
aggressor_player is the player index of who killed em, possibly emself, or -1 if killed by non-player.
There are no mnemonics for "action" at this time, making its use difficult.
projectile is the projectile that delivered the final blow, or -1 if there is no such projectile.


player_damaged(victim_player_index, aggressor_player_index, aggressor_monster_index, damage_type, damage_amount, projectile)

Whenever a player has taken damage, but before he dies if applicable.
aggressor_player_index will be -1 if the victim was damaged by a non-player.
aggressor_monster_index will be -1 if the victim was damaged by neither a player nor a monster.
damage_type is one of the Damage Types, e.g. _damage_fusion.
damage_amount is the amount recently subtracted from the player.  If _damage_oxygen_drain, damage_amount was
assessed against player's oxygen; else against player's suit energy.
projectile is the projectile that delivered the damage, or -1 if there is no such projectile.
The player's suit energy or oxygen may be negative when this trigger is called; if it still is when the trigger
returns, it will be set to 0.
The player's suit energy is tested again after this trigger returns, so a script may prevent a player's death.


monster_killed(monster, aggressor_player, projectile)

Whenever a monster dies.
This is called after a monster has taken lethal damage, but before it's removed form the monster list.
You can use this to find out when a monster created with new_monster dies,
but a monster discovered by select_monster may have already taken lethal damage,
so you may need to check for that case when using select_monster. 
aggressor_player is the player index of who killed it, or -1 if killed by non-player.
projectile is the projectile that delivered the final blow, or -1 if there is no such projectile.


item_created(item_index)

Whenever an item is created and placed on the ground (or floating) somewhere.
You can then use the item_index with some of the item accessor functions
to find out its type, polygon, etc. and base some decisions off that.
NOTE: Currently, this does not trigger on initial item placement because
the initial item placement is done before Lua becomes initialised.


projectile_detonated(type, owner, polygon, x, y, z)

Whenever a projectile detonates, after it has done any area of effect damage.


2 A1 Functions
--------------

These are functions defined in A1 which scripts can call.


2.1 Players
-----------

get_player_position (player)

Returns three values - the x, y, and z coordinates of player in W.U.


set_player_position(player, x, y, z, polygon)

Sets the player's coordinates to the point x,y,z in polygon. (BE CAREFUL with this function!)

Returns true if player is dead, false if alive.


select_weapon(player, type)

Attempt to force player to ready the specifiec weapon.


player_control (player, move_type, value)

(jkvw: not sure how this works)
tiennou: In fact you can use it, but it's behavior is not really useful, and it's pretty hard to have a viable script with it. It's use is like "tell 'player' to 'move_type' by 'value' steps" (altought steps is not appropriate...)


teleport_player (player, poly)

Teleports player to poly, similarly to using a teleporter


teleport_player_to_level (player, level)

Teleports player to level.  Of course, all the other players will also go to that level.
(Note from tiennou: I'm not sure this actually work correctly, because the level index could be off by one... If anyone ever use this thing, tell me if it goes wrong)
(jkvw: Also be aware that the life of a script expires when you change levels.  (regardless of whether it was initiated by mml or network gather dialog))


enable_player(player)
disable_player(player)

Enable/Disable a player. The player cannot move...


player_to_monster_index (player)

Returns the monster index of player.


local_player_index ()

In the normal case, you shouldn't needed this.
You'll just make the game go out of sync.

NOTE: Items can be identified by item indices only when
the items are on the ground (or floating, etc.) - but
not when they are in a player's inventory.


item_index_valid (item_index)

Returns nil if item_index lies outside the acceptable range for item indices,
false if the item_index does not correspond to a current item in the game, or

to remove an item that a player is carrying, use remove_item instead.


add_item (player, type)

Attempts to give one item of the specified type to player.
Uses marathon's rules for item aquisition.
(for example, you can't use this to give a player a third shotgun
or more ammo than e is allowed to carry.)
Can be used to give players items that don't normally appear in inventory.
(such as invisibility)


remove_item (player, type)

Takes away one item of the specified type from player.
This only works for items that appear in inventory.
(jkvw: Bad things happen when you try to gank balls with this.  Use destroy_ball for that.)


count_item (player, type)

Returns the number of items of the specified type player has ininventory.
(jkvw: In some cases this will return -1, not 0, if a player has none of the specified item.  (I've observed this with balls and with dead players))

get_polygon_ceiling_height (poly)
set_polygon_floor_height (poly, height)
set_polygon_ceiling_height (poly, height)

Sets/Queries the floor/ceiling height of poly.
(jkvw: Is changing poly floor/ceiling heights on the fly a good idea)
(tiennou: There is no real problem with changing, the only thing I was able to see is texture misalignement... You can also use this to make platform with both floor & ceiling moving)
(jkvw: A careless mapmaker may create an untextured wall with this, too.  But yeah, using this is fine.)


number_of_polygons ()

Returns the number of polygons in the map.


get_polygon_type (poly)
set_polygon_type (poly, type)

Sets/Gets the polygon type.

set_platform_floor_height (poly, height)
set_platform_ceiling_height (poly, height)

These operate on the platform's heights.
(that is, not on the polygon floor/ceiling, but the position of the platform itself)


get_platform_index (poly)

If poly is a platform, it returns the polygon's platform index.


2.8 Camera
----------

create_camera

Adds a new Lua camera.


add_path_point(camera_index, polygon, point_x, point_y, point_z)

Add a point 'x,y,z' to camera 'camera_index' and put it in 'polygon'.


add_path_angle(camera_index, yaw, pitch, time)

Adds an angle 'yaw,pitch' to camera 'camera_index' with 'time'.
(tiennou: someone who knows what is the 'time' argument write something more useful here...)

activate_camera(player, camera_index)

Starts the camera 'camera_index' for player. Works only on local player.


deactivate_camera(camera_index)

Stops the camera 'camera_index' for the local player.


clear_camera(camera_index)

Deletes all points and angles for the camera 'camera_index'.


2.9 Display
-----------

(jkvw: Don't be scared off by "working only on local player" - these operate correctly, just in a roundabout way.  A1 compares the player index passed in to the local player index, calling the appropriate funciton if the indicies are the same.  (and does nothing otherwise)  So in a net game, screen_print(2, "hi") ends up printing "hi" to player 2 and doing nothing for the other players.)

screen_print([player,] message)

Prints message on the screen of player.
If no player is specified, prints to everyone.
Works only on local player.


screen_fade([player,] fade)

Make the fade 'fade_index' start for player.
If no player is specified, fades for everyone.
Works only on local player.


set_motion_sensor_state (player, state)

Turn on/off the motion sensor for player. Works only on local player.


get_motion_sensor_state (player)

Returns true if player's motion sensor is enabled, false if it is disabled. Works only on local player.

set_fog_color(r, g, b)
get_fog_depth()
get_fog_color()
set_underwater_fog_depth(depth)
set_underwater_fog_color(r, g, b)
get_underwater_fog_depth()
get_underwater_fog_color()

(tiennou: actually, fog is broken, but those specify the fog parameters (color & depth)


crosshairs_active(player)
set_crosshairs_state(player, state)

Gets/Sets the crosshairs state for player. Works only on local player.


zoom_active(player)
set_zoom_state(player, state)

Gets/Sets the tunnel (sniper-mode) vision for player. Works only on local player.


2.10 Scoring
------------


(jkvw: different game types are scored differently.
Time based games have scores in units of ticks.
Every Man For Himself doesn't use network score at all - it relies on kills)


award_points (player, amount)

Increases player's network game score by amount.
Negative values take points away.


award_kills (aggressor_player, slain_player, amount)

Increases aggressor_player's kill count against slain_player by amount.
Negative values take kills away.
Setting agressor_player and slain_player the same awards suicides.
These changes will affect slain_player's death count.


set_points (player, amount)

Sets player's network game score to amount.


set_kills (aggressor_player, slain_player, amount)

Sets aggressor_player's kill count against slain_player.
If aggressor_player and slain_player are the same, it sets suicides.
This will affect slain_player's death count.


get_points (player)

Returns player's network game score.


get_kills (aggressor_player, slain_player)

Returns the kill count of aggressor_player against slain player.
And of course, if they are the same, it returns the number of suicides.


2.11 Compass
------------


use_lua_compass ([player,] state)

Set who controls where the network compass points, either lua or normal network rules.
If player is specified, change only applies to that player.


set_lua_compass_state (player, compass_direction)

Points player's compass in the specified directon.  (if the lua compass is enabled)
The special value _network_compass_use_beacon doesn't point the compass in a specific direction;
it tells the lua compass to point at the location specified by set_lua_compass_beacon.
The "single wedge" mneumonics can be added to get bigger wedges.
(so to point compass N you can do _network_compass_nw + _network_compass_ne)


set_lua_compass_beacon (player, x, y)

Points player's compass towards the location x, y.
(if the lua compass is enabled and _network_compass_use_beacon is set for that player's lua compass state)


2.12 Projectiles
----------------

get_projectile_type (projectile)

Returns the projectile's type.


get_projectile_damage_type (projectile)

Returns the projectile's damage type.


get_projectile_owner (projectile)

Returns the index of the monster that fired projectile, or nil if that monster is no longer associated with the projectile. (won't work right with virulent projectiles)


set_projectile_owner (projectile, monster)

Set the index of the monster that fired the projectile. (The owner of a projectile won't be damaged by it directly.)


get_projectile_target (projectile)

Returns the index of the monster that this projectile is tracking, if it's guided.


set_projectile_target (projectile, monster)

Set the index of the monster that this projectile is tracking. Probably ignored if not guided.


projectile_index_valid(projectile)

Returns nil of projectile lies outside the acceptable range for projectile indices, false if it is an unused slot, or true if it is a valid, in use slot (which can be used with other projectile-related functions).


get_projectile_angle(projectile)
set_projectile_angle(projectile, yaw, pitch)

Returns/Sets both the facing (yaw) and the elevation (pitch) of projectile.


get_projectile_position(projectile)
set_projectile_position(projectile, polygon, x, y, z)

Returns/Sets the polygon and x, y, z position of projectile.


2.13 Other
----------


global_random ()

Returns a random number from A1's global random number generator.
(jkvw: so for a random integer in [0, n-1], you can do "math.mod (global_random (), n)")
This is preferred over random number functionality from lua.
(jkvw: Using lua's functions you may get out of sync in net games and incorrect film playback.)


better_random ()

Like global_random, but with much more useful statistical properties
than A1's global random number generator.


local_random ()

Returns a random number from A1's local random number generator.
This is a good way to put net games out of sync.


get_terminal_text_number (poly, line)

Return the permutation field (the terminal script ID) of the terminal of the line contained in poly.


set_terminal_text_number (poly, line, terminal_text_id)

Sets the permutation field (the terminal script ID) of the terminal of the line contained in poly to terminal_text_id. It can be used to display multiple terminal messages without having to add hundred of terminals hidden behind the first...


activate_terminal (player, text_no)

Activates terminal text "text_no" for the player.


play_sound(player, sound, pitch)

Plays sound to player at pitch. See the mnemonics for the sound list


play_music(track, [track, [...]])

clear_music()

Clears the level's playlist.


stop_music()

Stops the currently playing song and clears the level's playlist.


kill_script()

Stops the execution of the script.
(No more triggers will activate, but whichever one called kill_script() will continue normally.)

play_music(track, [track, [...]])

Appends all of the specified tracks to the end of the level's playlist.

Fades out the currently playing song over duration seconds (or 1 if not specified) and clears the level's playlist.


clear_music()

Clears the level's playlist.


stop_music()

Stops the currently playing song and clears the level's playlist.


annotations()

Returns an iterator function which returns information about every annotation on the map. An example of proper usage is:

for text,polygon,x,y in annotations() do
  -- ...
end

You need not ask any information beyond the annotation text.


get_map_environment()

Returns a the map's environment attributes. For example:

vacuum,magnetic,rebellion,low_gravity = get_map_environment()

4 Dynamic Limits
----------------

Symbols referring to the game's dynamic limits on various things.


MAXIMUM_MONSTERS_PER_MAP

The first invalid monster index.


MAXIMUM_PROJECTILES_PER_MAP

The first invalid projectile index.


MAXIMUM_OBJECTS_PER_MAP

The first invalid object index.
NOTE: Object indices can correspond to valid item indices, but not always (an
object is not necessarily an item). So, to determine if a given index from 0
to MAXIMUM_OBJECTS_PER_MAP-1 corresponds to an actual item, you would have to
use the item_index_valid function on it.
