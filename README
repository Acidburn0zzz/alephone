Aleph One/SDL README file
=========================


LICENSE
-------

Aleph One is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
See the file "COPYING" that is included in the distribution for details.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Aleph One/SDL has so far only been developed and tested on Linux/i386 and
BeOS/x86 R5. It will not work on other operating systems, and may not work on
architectures other than i386, PowerPC and 680x0 because there are still some
portablilty problems with the code (mainly data alignment problems and
assumptions that sizeof(long) = sizeof(void *) = 4, which are not yet
completely removed). You are, however, invited to test or fix it to run on
other systems.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

Aleph One/SDL requires the Simple DirectMedia (SDL) library, available from
the official SDL site:

  http://www.libsdl.org/

Note that if you didn't install SDL from source, you also have to install the
"SDL-devel" package.


INSTALLATION
------------

Unix:
  As with any autoconfiguring GNU software, installation is as easy as this:

   $ ./configure
   $ make
   [become root]
   # make install

  For a complete list of options that the "configure" script takes, type

   $ ./configure --help

  The most important option is

   --prefix=PREFIX

  which you can use to specify a different installation directory (the default
  is /usr/local). The Aleph One executable will be installed in PREFIX/bin, and
  the data files in PREFIX/share/AlephOne.

BeOS:
  There is a special Makefile for compiling under BeOS. Install Aleph One as
  follows:

   $ make -f Makefile.BeOS install

  This will create a new directory "AlephOne" in your "home" directory that
  contains the "AlephOne" application and the "Fonts", "Resources" and
  "Pfhortran_Language_Definition" data files. You can move the "AlephOne"
  directory anywhere you like as long as the application is kept together
  with the data files.

To play Aleph One, you will also need Marathon graphics, sound and map
files. Unfortunately, Bungie has not released these files to the public, so
you must own a copy of Marathon Infinity or the Marathon Infinity Demo
(although Aleph One was originally based on Marathon 2, it was extended to
use the Marathon Infinity data files). The Demo is freely available, but in
Mac format, so I've created an archive containing the necessary data files
from the Marathon Infinity Demo, converted to the formats needed by the SDL
version of Aleph One. Download this archive from my Aleph One/SDL page:

  http://www.uni-mainz.de/~bauec002/A1Main.html

The archive contains the files "Images", "Map", "Map.resources", "Shapes",
"Sounds" and "README". This archive has to be unpacked to

Unix:
  /usr/local/share/AlephOne  (unless you specified a different PREFIX above)

BeOS:
  The same directory as the "AlephOne" application.

If you have a Marathon Infinity or Marathon Trilogy Box Set CD, you can copy
the needed files from the CD. This is a bit complicated, however, due to some
ideosyncracies of the Mac HFS file system (every Mac file is really two files,
one "data fork" and one "resource fork"). Aleph One/SDL needs these files:

 "Images" (resource fork)
 "Map" (data fork)
 "Map.resources" (resource fork of "Map" file)
 "Music" (data fork, optional, not included in Demo)
 "Shapes" (data fork)
 "Sounds" (data fork)

Aleph One also needs the files "Fonts" and "Pfhortran_Language_Definition"
and "Resources", but these are included with the Aleph One/SDL distribution
and installed by "make install". Here's how to copy these files from an
Infinity/Trilogy CD under Linux:

 1. Mount the CD with the HFS file system (you will probably have to be
    root to do this):

     # mount -t hfs /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom

    If you mount CDs on a different mount point, such as "/cdrom", use that
    instead.

 2. Change to the right directory on the CD. This can be complicated because
    of the Mac special characters in the file names, but with TAB-completion
    or copying and pasting you will succeed.

     $ cd /mnt/cdrom/....

    You should now be in a directory containing the above mentioned files.

 3. The Linux HFS file system module has the useful property of handling
    Mac data and resource forks and making them available as separate files
    (the resource forks are in a hidden ".resource" directory). You can
    now copy the files:

     $ cp .resource/Images /usr/local/share/AlephOne/Images
     $ cp Map /usr/local/share/AlephOne/Map
     $ cp .resource/Map /usr/local/share/AlephOne/Map.resources
     $ cp Music /usr/local/share/AlephOne/Music
     $ cp Shapes /usr/local/share/AlephOne/Shapes
     $ cp Sounds /usr/local/share/AlephOne/Sounds

    That's it.


PLAYING ALEPH ONE
-----------------

Unix:
  To start Aleph One, type

   $ alephone

BeOS:
  To start Aleph One, double click the "AlephOne" application icon. If you want
  to specify arguments or see error messages, you will have to start it from the
  shell, however.

The program can take a number of command line arguments. Here is a complete
list:

  [-h | --help]        Display the help message
  [-v | --version]     Display the game version
  [-f | --fullscreen]  Run the game fullscreen
  [-s | --nosound]     Do not access the sound card

If Aleph One complains about missing data files, and you are sure that you
have installed them, try setting the ALEPHONE_DATA environment variable to
the path of the data file directory. You can also use this to switch between
different scenarios, but you will have to delete the preferences file

Unix:
  ~/.alephone/Aleph One Preferences

BeOS:
  /boot/home/config/settings/Aleph One/Aleph One Preferences

if you do so.

The background story of the game and the keyboard controls are explained in
the manual or README file on your Marathon CD or in the Demo archive.
Here is a rundown of the default keyboard configuration (assuming a US
keyboard; all keys are mapped by position):

  On the menu screen:
    N - Start new game
    C - Show game credits
    Q - Quit

  During the game:
    KP8     - Walk forward
    KP5     - Walk backward
    KP4     - Turn left
    KP6     - Turn right

    Z       - Sidestep left
    X       - Sidestep right

    D       - Look up
    C       - Look down
    V       - Look ahead

    A       - Glance left
    S       - Glance right

    Space   - Fire weapon, primary trigger
    Alt     - Fire weapon, secondary trigger (e.g. grenades)
    KP7     - Select previous weapon
    KP9     - Select next weapon

    Tab     - Action (open doors, flip switches, log in to computer terminals)

    Shift   - Sidestep
    Ctrl    - Walk slowly (this is different from the original Marathon games;
              in Aleph One you run by default)
    Meta    - Keyboard look

    M       - Overhead map
    -       - Zoom overhead map out
    =       - Zoom overhead map in

    \       - Toggle FPS display

    Esc     - Quit game
    Ctrl-Q  - Quit game
    Ctrl-P  - Pause game (press Ctrl-P again to resume)

    F1      - Decrease screen size
    F2      - Increase screen size
    F6      - Toggle chase cam
    F7      - Toggle tunnel vision
    F8      - Toggle crosshairs
    F9      - Screen dump (saved in ~/.alephone/Screenshot_*.bmp files)
    F10     - Toggle position display
    F11     - Decrease gamma level (8-bit mode only)
    F12     - Increase gamma level (8-bit mode only)

    ,       - Decrease sound volume
    .       - Increase sound volume
    [ and ] - Scroll player inventory view

MISSING FEATURES AND BUGS
-------------------------

The SDL version of Aleph One is a work in progress. Here is an (incomplete)
list of the missing features, listed in roughly the order I plan to implement
them:

 - Mouse control
 - Chapter screen sounds
 - Intro music (not included in Demo, anyway)
 - Physics models in map files are not loaded (needed for playing Marathon
   Infinity properly)
 - Saving/restoring games (save terminals don't work and the "Continue Saved
   Game" button on the title screen is nonfunctional)
 - Saving/replaying films (the "Replay Saved Film", "Replay Last Film" and
   "Save Last Film" buttons on the title screen are nonfunctional)
 - OpenGL rendering
 - Preferences menus (the "Preferences" button on the title screen is
   nonfunctional)
 - Networking (the "Gather Network Game" and "Join Network Game" buttons on
   the title screen are nonfunctional)
 - The game could run faster in 16-bit mode on some machines if an RGB 565
   renderer was implemented

And a list of known bugs:

 - Palette tricks (fading, underwater, red flash when being hit etc.) don't
   work
 - Lo-res mode (F3) doesn't work
 - All error messages are those of the Mac version, which are often
   inappropriate or misleading. For example, the program will ask the user
   to put the data files into the same directory as the Aleph One executable,
   which is wrong under Unix. There, the data files have to be in
   /usr/local/share/AlephOne.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If Aleph One crashes or behaves strangely on startup, try deleting the files

Unix:
  ~/.alephone/Aleph One Preferences
  ~/.alephone/Aleph One Recording

BeOS:
  /boot/home/config/settings/Aleph One/Aleph One Preferences
  /boot/home/config/settings/Aleph One/Aleph One Recording

and try again.

If the game runs very slowly, you may want to run it in 8 bit mode (default
is 16 bit). To do this, you have to change the line

  graphics_preferences->screen_mode.bit_depth = 16;

in Misc/shell_sdl.cpp to

  graphics_preferences->screen_mode.bit_depth = 8;

and recompile. Setting your screen to 15 bit color depth (RGB 555) instead of
16 bit (RGB 565) may also help.


SUPPORT
-------

Aleph One is not officially supported by Bungie Software, so don't bother
contacting them about it.

The official Aleph One home page is at

  http://source.bungie.org/

My home page for the SDL port is at

  http://www.uni-mainz.de/~bauec002/A1Main.html

If you have questions about Marathon in general, you should post them to
the established marathon forums, such as alt.games.marathon.


Happy carnage!
