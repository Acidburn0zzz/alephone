 - added endianess-correction to Map, Shapes and Sound file reading routines
 - removed byte_swap_collection() and associated data because the idea was
   good but the implementation was bogus (as it assumed that structure fields
   would be aligned in the same way on all machines)
 - Mac-specific code for computer terminals now in computer_interface_macintosh.c
 - some fixes to errors and warnings reported by gcc

August 20, 2000
 - added definitions and code for the SDL port
 - added integer types with specific bit size to replace "byte", "word", "long"
   and "short" in cases where the exact size matters (structures read from disk):
     int8/uint8
     int16/uint16
     int32/uint32
   These are not yet used in all places, though.
 - renamed pause() to pause_debug() and random() to global_random() because of
   name clashes with Unix functions of the same name
 - put "#ifdef HAVE_OPENGL" around calls to OpenGL-related functions to make
   it possible to compile A1 without OpenGL
 - w_open_preferences_file() takes a C string as the file name instead of a
   Pascal string
 - implemented resource fork parser for non-Mac platforms
